### About
This coding quiz had 4 questions, the user being able to select the correct answer and get a score calculated. If the user got the answer to the questions wrong, 10 seconds was deducted. A final score was calculated and allowed the user the input the score to be saved in a highscore section.


### Problems
The highscore page is functional but unable to save the user's score to local storage. I was unable to figure that aspect out.

The following coding quiz utilized Javascript, DOM, HTML, CSS.
